# New Provider Guide

Adding a provider is a cross-contract change. It requires Rust metadata and
normalization, deterministic fixtures, an approved icon, official installation
and login behavior, QML rendering compatibility, settings migration, and
documentation.

## Adapter

Implement the two required methods; `discover` and `login_command` have
catalog-driven default bodies that none of the five shipped adapters
override:

```rust
pub trait ProviderAdapter: Send + Sync {
    fn descriptor(&self) -> &'static ProviderDescriptor;

    // Defaulted: catalog-driven discovery.
    fn discover(
        &self,
        env: &ExecutionEnvironment,
    ) -> Result<Discovery, CatalogError> { /* default body */ }

    // Defaulted: login argv from the catalog descriptor.
    fn login_command(
        &self,
        discovery: &Discovery,
    ) -> Result<ProcessSpec, LoginError> { /* default body */ }

    fn collect<'a>(
        &'a self,
        context: &'a CollectionContext<'a>,
        discovery: &'a Discovery,
    ) -> BoxFuture<'a, ProviderResult>;
}
```

(The `/* default body */` comments are intentional documentation elision —
the real bodies live in `src/providers/adapter.rs` and stay out of the
doc.)

`CollectionContext` provides narrow process, HTTP, filesystem, clock, and
redaction capabilities. Do not force HTTP/filesystem/composite providers into a
fake command abstraction.

## Catalog entry

Add exactly one descriptor containing:

- stable lowercase ID;
- English display name;
- approved icon key;
- official HTTPS documentation page for installation;
- executable and login discovery metadata;
- login argv;
- TTL and timeout;
- output cap and retry policy.

Use the typed `ProviderDescriptor` and path-template shape in
`docs/specs/v10/02-target-architecture.md`. The catalog is the only provider
order and metadata source. Never store an installer script URL as the
`view_installation` target, and never concatenate login argv into a shell
string.

The adapter, not the descriptor, owns collection source precedence, stable
window IDs/labels, bounded filesystem traversal, parser fixtures, and raw-error
classification. Add those values to the locked collection-policy table before
implementing a new provider.

## Discovery

Collection availability and login availability are separate. A provider may
collect from existing HTTP credentials or local data without an installed
interactive login CLI.

CLI discovery verifies executable permission, not only file existence.

Consulting the collection executable is itself optional: Claude and Grok
collect purely from credential files plus HTTP and never read the
collection-discovery result; only Amp, Codex, and Antigravity resolve the
discovered executable.

## Process invocation notes

- Amp runs its CLI with `NO_COLOR=1` and `TERM=dumb` forced into the
  environment to guarantee plain non-interactive output.
- Antigravity forces the same `NO_COLOR=1`/`TERM=dumb` pair, plus an
  `agy --version` guard call before `agy --print /usage --output-format json`
  (windows are read by their stable bucket ids); a CLI older than
  1.1.11 is refused without ever running the usage command, because older
  builds forward `/usage` to the model as an ordinary prompt.
- Codex retries the app-server RPC once manually (short sleep, one re-run)
  when it times out — independent of, and in addition to, the catalog-level
  retry policy used for HTTP providers.

## Normalization

Return typed percentage windows:

- stable ID and English label;
- finite used/remaining values in `0..=100`;
- sum within 0.01 of 100;
- UTC reset or `null`;
- typed provider state and safe error/action.

Do not return:

- raw provider output;
- HTML/ANSI;
- credentials or account identifiers;
- `-1` or textual sentinels;
- spend, balance, credits, currency, cost, or arbitrary extras.

A connected provider with no percentage quota returns an empty windows array.
The UI renders `—`.

## Error mapping

Map raw failures to:

```text
cli_missing
unauthenticated
rate_limited
network_error
provider_error
```

Temporary failure with last good data becomes `stale` at the coordinator.
Messages are safe English copy. Control flow never uses regex over the message.

## Required fixtures

For the new provider add:

- ready percentage data;
- connected with no percentage window;
- missing collection source;
- login unavailable;
- unauthenticated;
- rate-limited;
- network failure;
- malformed output;
- timeout/termination;
- sanitization probe;
- single-provider/all-provider equality.

Tests use fake process/HTTP/filesystem data only.

## UI and assets

- Add the approved provider icon. Monochrome marks must be a
  white-on-transparency mask (mark-grade artwork, not a filled app icon);
  the runtime tints them to the theme foreground at render time.
- Verify chip, rail, tooltip, provider header, every state, keyboard order, and
  accessibility label.
- Add light/dark deterministic screenshots.
- Do not add provider-specific parsing or arbitrary fields to QML.

## Completion checklist

1. Descriptor and adapter.
2. Fixtures and contract tests.
3. Settings schema/default/migration update.
4. Bundle receipt and icon.
5. QML state/accessibility tests.
6. Active documentation.
7. Full Rust, QML, manifest, bundle, and legacy gates.
